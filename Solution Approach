Step 2 : Oberservational Data Analysis






Step 3 : Statistical Analysis Part 1 : Finding Co-relation between events 

Found co-relation coefficient between events for every event with respective to other 279 events.Consider two variables say 
Explanatory(EEvent) and Responsive Event(REvent)

Approach :  
 - Need to cleanse data and clustering of related source sytem events (Requires Subject Matter Expert , Not in Scope)
 - For given day , Calculate the no. of occurence of EEvent with respective to REvent and loaded the data into table ' '

Tool Used: SQL Developer 
Code     : Plsql , refer the document <>

Step 4 : Statistical Analysis  Part 2 : Finding the Average time for the occurence of 

Approach : 
  - Find the list of events having positive co-relation coefficient from Step 3
  - Find the distance (Time difference between the Responsive Event and Explanatory Event)
  - Bucket the distance into appropriate bucket intervals
  - Plot the Bucket Versus
