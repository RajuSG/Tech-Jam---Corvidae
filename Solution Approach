Step 1 : Loading Data into Oracle Database Using SQL Loader

Commands

##Event Definition 

##Event Logger

##Event System and Subsystem

Step 2 : Oberservational Data Analysis

Goal : Visualize the system , subsytem  , Events triggered for given customer to take quick action on the 
incidents raised by customer .

Approach : 

-- Classify each event as Metadata change ( Manual , System)  , System Generated (Limited time , Not in Scope)
-- An

Tool Used : Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) ( So Called 'ABI' in Akamai)

Step 3 : Statistical Analysis Part 1 : Finding Co-relation between events 
 
Found co-relation coefficient between events for every event with respective to other 279 events.Consider two variables say 
Explanatory(EEvent) and Responsive Event(REvent)

Approach :  
 - Need to cleanse data and clustering of related source sytem events (Requires Subject Matter Expert , Not in Scope)
 - For given day , Calculate the no. of occurence of EEvent with respective to REvent and loaded the data into table ' '

Tool Used: SQL Developer 
Code     : Plsql , refer the document <>

Visualization 2 : Using Martix chart represent co-relation coefficient(r) between events

Tool Used : Online Circos
Code      : Attached visualization

PN : Data will be restricted certain events for given small set of related systems and subsystems


Step 4 : Statistical Analysis  Part 2 : Finding the Average time distance for the occurence of Responsive Event 
for given Explanatory Event

Approach : 
  - Find the list of events having positive co-relation coefficient from Step 3
  - Find the distance (Time difference between the Responsive Event and Explanatory Event)
  - Bucket the distance into appropriate bucket intervals
  - Plot the Bucket Versus Time distance

Extensibility : 

-- Extend the analysis to find the relation between the events and incidents raised by the customer using statistical modesl
-- Clustering of events for better analsis
-- Management reports - Measure how efficient akamai system designs , High Frequency events
